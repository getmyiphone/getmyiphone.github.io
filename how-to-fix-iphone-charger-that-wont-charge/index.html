<p>No when any device is plugged in I do NOT expect it to drain and turn off. That helped for one night but then it wouldnt charge unless i put the charger in and pushed it toward the side a little bit and put an object against it to hold it in place. In order to assure ourselves as the phone is not dead especially due to some insufficient or depleted battery life wait for 15-20 minutes till it gets to charge for some time. That worked for a couple of days but now it just wont charge at all. None of this worked i havent contacted any1 yet but my computer wont charge i plug it in it will stay at whatever percentage it is at it.</p>
