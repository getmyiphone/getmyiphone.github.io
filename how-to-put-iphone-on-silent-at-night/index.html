<p>In some cases the switch gets stuck on ring which means that entering silent mode requires special workarounds to fix. If this was a cheaper case I would put up with the fact that it has only lasted a year but at the price I paid this was not at all worth the money. Since you may not want your iPhone turned on all the time you can turn the phone off or keep it locked or put it to sleep mode. I switched to ring mode from silent mode using the top left button and as usual the phone was unresponsive. The RingSilent switch is stupid.</p>
