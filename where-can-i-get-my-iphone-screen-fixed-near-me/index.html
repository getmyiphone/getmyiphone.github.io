<p>They fixed my iPad Air glass screen and sent it back on the same day. We fix all models of iPhone but one of the most common models we see come in is the iPhone 6. Im glad that I got the Otterbox and screen protector because Ive dropped my phone 3 times since and there are no cracks or anything. The 61-inch Liquid Retina screen on the iPhone XR delivers a true-to-life experience for users. It seems bizarre that I can see the calls from people that are phoning me but I cant save my photos.</p>
