<p>The sooner we switch away from carbon-based fuel and start relying on renewable energy sources available in the United States the sooner we will grow our economy by creating the millions of new jobs that will come from retrofitting homes and businesses building smart grids renewable energy systems and planting trees and all the rest. Renewable energy is about more than just electricity generation. Geothermal energy is the thermal energy in the Earths crust which originates from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions. Also remember that becoming a renewable energy entrepreneur doesnt mean you have to build your own wind farm or hydroelectric dam. This results in parts of the mantle convecting upward.</p>
