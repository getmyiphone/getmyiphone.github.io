<p>Received my IPhone a few days ago and everything is working. The only downside is with trying to unlock the phone with Face ID while wearing a mask sure doesnt work. I was hesitant to buy it due to the bad reviews but my phone is unlocked checked with Apple and I love it. If youd like to connect to a cellular data network later you can reach out to a carrier to finish activation. You can see in the photo that I chose a clear case with white lace pattern.</p>

<p>Once your new iPhone is activated it remains unlocked which means you can use it with any network. You can see in the photo that I chose a clear case with white lace pattern. My seller was 2019bestsale its a little bit more expensive but worth it. Theres a barely noticeable scratch on the screen but that is normal since it is refurbished. I was hesitant to buy it due to the bad reviews but my phone is unlocked checked with Apple and I love it.</p>

<p>If youd like to connect to a cellular data network later you can reach out to a carrier to finish activation. Received my IPhone a few days ago and everything is working. The size is perfect. Upgraded from an iPhone eight. Once your new iPhone is activated it remains unlocked which means you can use it with any network.</p>
