<p>Metalenz maker of highly compact 2D cameras for advanced sensin. Lidar IR ultrasonic and so on. Otherwise a lot of the data on this is just not useful to some people. Trying to delete and add files manually made it worse. Why does the amount of screen-time logged for the phone for the day so much larger than the sum of the amounts of screen-time logged for each app ie family member See All Activity Total Screen Time reads 2h 34m while the sum of the MOST USED apps could be half that.</p>

Lidar IR ultrasonic and so on. Now its available for pc desktop as well through chrome app.</p>
