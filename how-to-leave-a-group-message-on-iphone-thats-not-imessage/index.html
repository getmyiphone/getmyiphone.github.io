<p>The bullying with green bubbles exists entirely from group chats. Thats how this started. Texts were constantly dropping so people would think I was ignoring messages. Most users were likely not aware that when they open iMessage the default SMS application on their brand new iPhone and send a message to another user by phone number that the application is actually choosing between routing that message via iMessage through Apples backend or via SMS over their carriers network. Group chats become impossible with iphone users so you stop being invited.</p>
